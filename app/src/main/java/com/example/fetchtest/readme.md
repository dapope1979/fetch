This repository contains my submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise.

There are definitely some practices skipped in this submission that I'd want to include in a production app:
* Handling Network request errors & informing user
* Placeholder or loading indicator while data is loading
* Use of Dagger/Hilt for dependency injection
* Actual unit testing
* Previews for composables
